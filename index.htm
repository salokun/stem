<h2 style="font-size:40px;">ORGANIZATION HISTORY</h2>
<p style="color:red;">I welcome you to IGNITE STEM, a great organisation geared towards raising a new 
generation of innovative minds in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM). I owe you a responsibility to take you through a short story of how 
the organisation came about. 
In the wake of the year 2013 during the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) 
programme, I took up a volunteer job with DAYSTAR CHRISTIAN CENTRE as a science 
tutor for students taking the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), a 
necessity to securing an admission placement into polytechnics and universities in 
Nigeria. My volunteering lasted almost two years; amidst that I tutored several learners in 
the STEM fields in my private times. One major underlying challenge I came across for 
most of these learners was their disinterest in learning STEM; this in part stems from the 
teachers they have in their classrooms and on top of it was the disconnect between what 
is taught in the classroom and the real-world. The latter I solved by using real-world 
analogies to explain phenomenon and definitions. I enjoyed what I did then as a tutor 
trying to get students back on track to learning STEM in a more enjoyable way. The rest 
they say is history. Found my way to my alma Mata Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife 
Nigeria in the month of August 2015 to kick-start my Masters degree program, although 
against my wish. I could not pass on the urge to make a difference in helping students 
enjoy learning STEM and ultimately turning that knowledge into something viable. One 
evening after my spare time I resolved to organise a STEM fair and exhibition for schools 
around the town where our campus was located for students to showcase their built

projects to some invited guests and the general public. We had a nine-member team who 
consulted with schools and the overall logistics that is to be involved. Among them today 
is Dayo Ekundayo, a strong standing member of the IGNITE STEM team today. The team 
met weekly mostly Sunday evenings to give reports on the consultations with schools. 
The big blow came in one of the meetings when it was related that none of the schools 
they consulted with had an idea of what the program was about, but although remarked 
that would be a great one to be involved in. Their lack of interest stems from the 
constraints of shortage of STEM teachers, financial resources and a host of others. We 
knew work was set for us at that point. The following year 2016, January to be precise 
the IGNITE STEM CLUB was born. It was born out of passion to ignite the interest of 
pupils and students with experiments and projects that are related to what is taught in the
classroom and common place materials in a bid to help them understand the basic 
science taught in the classroom. The first club activities held in August 2016 at Christway 
Schools, Ile-Ife, since then we have gone to impact pupils and students in different 
schools in their tens of thousands every term and every year. (EO).</p>
<h3 style="font-size:40px;color:red">CORPORATE VISION </h3> 
<p style="color:blue;">We live and exist to be and be recognized as the world’s leading provider of Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education through innovative 
solutions that build and empower innovative minds towards a self-reliant society.
We will achieve this by dedicating ourselves to providing qualitative STEM education that 
liberates young minds to inspire, to explore, to involve, to innovate and to lead. Over the 
years we have crystallized our corporate activities into three main pillars;

Corporate Activities
1. To achieve scientific literacy for all irrespective of age, religion, ethnicity, race and 
socioeconomic class. 
2. To inspire young minds to learn Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 
(STEM) and pursue STEM careers. 
3. To raise STEM proficiency level with the goal of equipping minds to become problem￾solvers and solution thinkers to combat the pressing challenges of humanity and the 
global community. 
Also our values describe the approach and the manner in which we want to work to 
achieve our goals (vision). Our values represent who we are. They serve as our compass; 
not only do they define us, but they guide us at the same time. Together, our Vision and 
Values form the framework for all of our decisions and activities. They serve as both an 
orientation and a guideline for leadership, and also define our corporate culture. We build 
our organization from within, promoting and rewarding people without regard to any 
difference unrelated to performance. We act on the conviction that the men and women 
of IGNITE STEM will always be our most important asset.
Our Values
1. Sustainable Profitable Growth And Performance
2. Innovation For The Success Of Our Consumers
3. Personal And Professional Competence
4. Mutual Respect And Open Dialogue
